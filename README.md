# UP2C
UP2C is a tool used for transforming a Roblox User:Pass combo list to Cookies (or User:Pass:Cookie)  
Captchas are solved using anti-captcha.
## Setup
  1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  2. Download and extract this repository
  3. Run `npm install`
  4. Add a file called combo.txt which will contain your User:Pass combos
  5. Add a file called proxies.txt which will contain your proxies in `http(s)://(user:pass@)host:port` format
  6. Edit the settings in main.js
  7. Run `node main.js`
  8. Done! :tada:. Cookies will be put in output.txt
## Notes
By using this tool, I assume you know what you are doing.  
I will NOT be providing ANY support on how to use this tool.  
2captcha is currently not supported, however a pull request to add support for it is welcome.  
For the love of god, please do not sell cookies or change the passwords from the alts found with NoMorals alt gen.
